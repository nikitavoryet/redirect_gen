# php redirect
To use the script, your server must support .htaccess. Contact your hosting service to clarify this fact.

# use
In the "go" folder, edit the data.txt file.
On each line, enter the short name you want to use for the redirect, then press the Tab key, then paste the url to which the redirect should occur. It should look something like this:

# ATTENTION
Note: the separation between the short name and url should be exactly the Tab key, not the spacebar!
You can also create an Excel-file, in the first column short names, in the second address for redirection, and then just copy all the data into a text document.

#example
video https://vk.com
club https://github.com
timer https://skype.com
100 http://google.com
